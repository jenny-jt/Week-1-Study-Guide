Skills function practice.

Please read the the instructions first (separate file). Your solutions should
go below this docstring.

PART ONE:

    >>> hello_world()
    Hello World

    >>> say_hi("Balloonicorn")
    Hi Balloonicorn

    >>> print_product(3, 5)
    15

    >>> repeat_string("Balloonicorn", 3)
    BalloonicornBalloonicornBalloonicorn

    >>> print_sign(3)
    Higher than 0

    >>> print_sign(0)
    Zero

    >>> print_sign(-3)
    Lower than 0

    >>> is_divisible_by_three(12)
    True

    >>> is_divisible_by_three(10)
    False

    >>> num_spaces("Balloonicorn is awesome!")
    2

    >>> num_spaces("Balloonicorn is       awesome!")
    8

    >>> total_meal_price(30)
    34.5

    >>> total_meal_price(30, .3)
    39.0

    >>> sign_and_parity(3)
    ['Positive', 'Odd']

    >>> sign_and_parity(-2)
    ['Negative', 'Even']

PART TWO:

    >>> full_title("Balloonicorn")
    'Engineer Balloonicorn'

    >>> full_title("Jane Hacks", "Hacker")
    'Hacker Jane Hacks'

    >>> write_letter("Jane Hacks", "Hacker", "Balloonicorn")
    Dear Hacker Jane Hacks, I think you are amazing! Sincerely, Balloonicorn

# PART ONE

def hello_world():
    print('Hello World')

def say_hi(name):
    print(f'Hi {name}')


def print_product(n1,n2):
    prod = n1 * n2
    print(prod)


def repeat_string(string,n):
    new_s = string * n
    print(new_s)
    

# 5. Write a function called 'print_sign' that takes an integer and prints
#    "Higher than 0" if higher than zero and "Lower than 0" if lower than zero.
#    If the integer is zero, print "Zero".
def print_sign(n):
    print("Higher than 0" if n>0 else "Zero" if n == 0 else "Lower than 0")
    

# 6. Write a function called 'is_divisible_by_three' that takes an integer and
#    returns a boolean (True or False), depending on whether the number is
#    evenly divisible by 3.
def is_divisible_by_three(n):
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# 7. Write a function called 'num_spaces' that takes a sentence as one string
#    and returns the number of spaces.
def num_spaces(sentence):
    spaces = list(sentence).count(' ')
    return spaces

# 8. Write a function called 'total_meal_price' that can be passed a meal price
#    and a tip percentage. It should return the total amount paid
#    (price + price * tip). **However:** passing in the tip percentage should
#    be optional; if not given, it should default to 15%.
def total_meal_price(price,tip=.15):
    total_paid = price + price*tip
    return total_paid


# 9. Write a function called 'sign_and_parity' that takes an integer as an
#    argument and returns two pieces of information as strings --- "Positive"
#    or "Negative" and "Even" or "Odd". The two strings should be returned in
#    a list.

def sign_and_parity(n):
    s_p = []
    sign = 'Positive' if n>0 else 'Negative'
    parity = 'Even' if n%2 == 0 else 'Odd'
    s_p.extend([sign, parity])
    return s_p
#
#    Then, write code that shows the calling of this function on a number and
#    unpack what is returned into two variables --- sign and parity (whether
#    it's even or odd). Print sign and parity.

print(sign_and_parity(20))

# PART TWO

# 1. Write a function called full_title that takes a name and a job title as
#    parameters, making it so the job title defaults to "Engineer" if a job
#    title is not passed in. Return the person's title and name in one string.
def full_title(name, job_title = "Engineer"):
    print(f"'{job_title} {name}'")
    
# 2. Write a function called write_letter that, given a recipient name & job
#    title and a sender name, prints the following letter:
#
#       Dear JOB_TITLE RECIPIENT_NAME, I think you are amazing!
#       Sincerely, SENDER_NAME.
#
#    Use the function from #1 to construct the full title for the letter's
#    greeting.
def write_letter(recipient_name,job_title,sender_name):
    print(f'Dear {job_title} {recipient_name}, I think you are amazing! Sincerely, {sender_name}')
